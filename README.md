Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks
This project aims to classify the images in the given dataset as cats or dogs using convolutional neural networks(CNN) and support vector machine(SVM)

Ensure python3 is installed and you have pip or pip3 installed as well
Some important pip libraries needed:
os, cv2, pickle, tensorflow, keras, copy, random, numpy, scikitLearn
I was unable to set this up in colab due to time restraints around setting up the datasets in the project.

Instructions to run the code:
[Input dataset] \train1, \train2, and \test

- Go to directory:  _cd Code/_
- To start the training run: 
    - _$ python main.py_
